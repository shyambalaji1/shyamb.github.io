I have tried to involve myself in volunteer work with varying goals from when I started my undergraduate studies in Australia till now. The main focus since then has favoured a direct action approach around the following
<p>
<ul>
<li> Academic mentorship for underrepresented communites</li>
<li> Reducing extreme poverty</li>
<li> Support for those in need or homeless locally</li>
<li> Educational support for refugees and vulnerable communities</li>
<li> Animal welfare and rehabilitation</li>
<li> Aid at orphanages</li>
</ul>

<b>Academic mentorship for underrepresented communites</b>
<br>
<p>
<p class="justified-text">
I am currently academic mentor in the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis/black-engineers-project-information">Success for Black Engineers and Scientists</a> program at King's College London. The program aims to support aspiring black engineers and physicists from school through university. It includes outreach workshops, tutoring, mentoring schemes, summer research placements, and industry engagement events. The program addresses the lower attainment and under-representation of Black students in engineering and physics, striving to increase their presence and success. Academic mentors such as myself, who are academic staff members, provide guidance on academic matters, help students navigate their coursework, and offer advice on career planning. They meet with students regularly to discuss their progress, address any challenges, and provide encouragement and support.

<b>Reducing extreme poverty</b>
<br>
<p>
<p class="justified-text">
I worked with the <a href="https://www.oaktree.org/">Oaktree Foundation</a>. Oaktree is an Australian-based, non-government organisation that specialises in international youth development. Their purpose is to lead, demand and create a more just world. I have participated in fundraising efforts for the <a href="https://bafuturu.org/publications/Oaktree_Evaluation_Report_final.pdf">"Ba Futuru"</a> program in East Timor, which focuses on youth empowerment, child protection, and peace-building through innovative educational approaches. Ba Futuru aims to build a peaceful and productive Timor-Leste by reducing community-based violence and empowering young learners. Additionally, I have also been involved in the <a href="https://opportunity.org/learn/about/live-below-the-line">"Live Below the Line"</a> campaign, an international challenge where participants live on less than $1.50 a day for five days to raise awareness and funds for those living in extreme poverty. This campaign not only highlights the daily struggles of over a billion people but also mobilizes resources to support poverty alleviation initiatives.

<b>Support for those in need or homeless locally</b>
<br>
<p>
<p class="justified-text">
I am currently volunteering with <a href="https://charitybeginsathome.org/">Charity Begins at Home</a>. "Charity Begins at Home" is a London-based charity dedicated to supporting homeless and disadvantaged individuals. Since its inception in 2016, the charity has been providing food, clothing, and essential items to those in need.  We offer substantial food bags with hot meals, water, juices, sandwiches, crisps, bread, bakery items, yoghurts, chocolates, fruits, and more. Essential items like clothing, sleeping bags, and tents are also provided. The team ensures a warm welcome for all. This initiative ensures that recipients have enough supplies to last through the weekend.
<p>
Prior to this I was also doing soup van volunteering in Australia. This involved distributing hot meals and essential items to homeless individuals directly on the streets. We typically drove around designated areas, offering food, drinks, and sometimes clothing or hygiene products, providing immediate relief and support to those in need.

<b>Educational support for refugees and vulnerable communities</b>
<br>
<p>
<p class="justified-text">
I have worked with <a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/students/experience/volunteering/">Curtin Volunteers!</a> Homework Help program in Perth, Australia. This was dedicated to supporting high school students from vulnerable backgrounds. This initiative provides much-needed academic assistance in physics and mathematics, helping students improve their understanding and performance. We worked closely with students, offering personalized tutoring and mentorship, which not only enhances their academic skills but also boosts their confidence and motivation. Our goal was to foster a supportive learning environment, aiming to bridge educational gaps and empower students to achieve their full potential.

<b>Animal welfare and rehabilitation</b>
<br>
<p>
<p class="justified-text">
I have previously worked with the <a href=https://www.wfft.org/">Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand (WFFT)</a> for the <a href=https://www.wfft.org/projects/elephant-refuge/">Elephant Refuge Program</a>. It is dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating elephants that have been abused or exploited in industries such as trekking and logging. The program provides a safe, chain-free sanctuary where elephants can roam freely in large, naturalistic enclosures that include trees, lakes, and grazing area.

Volunteers at WFFT play take care of the daily care and enrichment of the elephants. Our tasks included preparing food, feeding the elephants, cleaning enclosures, and assisting with veterinary care when needed. We also help with educational tours and activities, raising awareness about the plight of elephants and promoting ethical tourism practices. This hands-on experience not only supports the well-being of the elephants but also educates volunteers about wildlife conservation and animal welfare.

<b>Aid at orphanages</b>
<br>
<p>
<p class="justified-text">
I have worked for <a href="https://www.volunteerforever.com/program/idex/">Idex</a>, an organization that offers volunteer programs in various countries, including Nepal. The program I was involved with had a focus on providing meaningful travel experiences that contribute positively to local communities. In Kathmandu, the key initiatives I was part of was the <a href="https://www.volunteerforever.com/program/idex/>https://soluchildrenwelfare.org/">Solu Orphanage program</a>.

Volunteering at the Solu Orphanage was aimed at supporting the well-being and development of the children. These activities include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Educational Support: Assisting with homework, teaching English, and helping with other subjects to enhance the children's academic skills.</li>
<li> Recreational Activities: Organizing games, sports, and creative activities to promote physical and mental well-being.</li>
<li> Daily Care: Helping with daily routines such as meal preparation, cleaning, and ensuring the children have a safe and nurturing environment.</li>
<li> Emotional Support: Providing companionship and emotional support to the children, helping them build confidence and self-esteem.</li>
<p>
</ul>
Our goal was to use the above activities to contribute to the overall growth and happiness of the kids at the Solu Orphanage.
